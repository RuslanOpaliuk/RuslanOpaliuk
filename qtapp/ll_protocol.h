/*
    This code is written in C language to make it portable.
Purpose of this code is to catch separate messages from the
bytes stream. That is done by serializing message on the
transmitter node and deserializing bytes stream on the receiver node.
Serializing means adding some extra bytes to message which
help to detect begin and the end of message in the bytes stream. These
bytes are BEGIN_BYTE, END_BYTE and REJECT_BYTE. They are called
"control bytes". BEGIN_BYTE is added at the beginning of message,
END_BYTE at the end of message, REJECT_BYTE is used to differentiate
control bytes from message bytes.

    You can define control bytes as you want but they must be
different from each other. For example, BEGIN_BYTE can be equal to
0x56, END_BYTE 0x65 and REJECT_BYTE 0xFF and so on. Defining
your own values for control bytes can be useful when the message
that you must serialize contains a lot of bytes which values are
the same as values of control bytes. That means that you can
decrease the redundancy. You can understand it better in the
examples below.

    NOTE. There is also control of message size. That means that
you can't serialize and deserialize a message with size (quantity of bytes)
that is not equal to MESSAGE_SIZE. MESSAGE_SIZE can be defined by you.
MESSAGE_SIZE must be equal both on transmitter and receiver nodes.

Examples (for MESSAGE_SIZE 16 bytes, BEGIN_BYTE 0xAA, END_BYTE 0xBB
and REJECT_BYTE 0xCC):

1. Message that we need to serialize and transmit:
   F3 77 56 C4 95 94 76 8B 12 88 34 DD 44 77 51 31

   Bytes stream after serializing:
   AA F3 77 56 C4 95 94 76 8B 12 88 34 DD 44 77 51 31 BB

   As you can see, resulting bytes stream that will be transmitted
   contains 18 bytes. More than MESSAGE_SIZE. So, the rendundancy for
   the message in this example is 2 bytes. As you can see BEGIN_BYTE
   added at the beginning of message and END_BYTE at the end of message.

2. Message that we need to serialize and transmit (mention that
   second byte has the same value as END_BYTE):
   F3 BB 56 C4 95 94 76 8B 12 88 34 DD 44 77 51 31

   Bytes stream after serializing:
   AA F3 CC BB 56 C4 95 94 76 8B 12 88 34 DD 44 77 51 31 BB

   Resulting bytes stream is 19 bytes. Rendundancy is 3 bytes. REJECT_BYTE
   is added before second byte of message to inform deserializator that
   this byte is not control byte. Without REJECT_BYTE deserializator
   would interpret that byte as the end of message.

3. Message that we need to serialize and transmit (mention that
   second byte has the same value as REJECT_BYTE):
   F3 CC 56 C4 95 94 76 8B 12 88 34 DD 44 77 51 31

   Bytes stream after serializing:
   AA F3 CC CC 56 C4 95 94 76 8B 12 88 34 DD 44 77 51 31 BB

   Resulting bytes stream is 19 bytes. Rendundancy is 3 bytes. REJECT_BYTE
   is added before second byte of message to inform deserializator that
   this byte is not control byte. Without REJECT_BYTE deserializator
   would interpret that byte as control byte.

4. Other examples.
   1)
   input:  F3 BB AA C4 95 CC 76 8B 12 CC 34 DD AA 77 51 BB
   output: AA F3 CC BB CC AA C4 95 CC CC 76 8B 12 CC CC 34 DD CC AA 77 51 CC BB BB
   bytes stream 24 bytes, redundancy 8 bytes

   2)
   input:  CC CC CC CC CC CC CC CC CC CC CC CC CC CC CC CC
   output: AA CC CC CC CC CC CC CC CC CC CC CC CC CC CC CC CC CC CC CC CC CC CC CC CC CC CC CC CC CC CC CC CC BB
   bytes stream 34 bytes, redundancy 18 bytes

   3)
   input:  AA AA AA AA AA AA AA AA AA AA AA AA AA AA AA AA
   output: AA CC AA CC AA CC AA CC AA CC AA CC AA CC AA CC AA CC AA CC AA CC AA CC AA CC AA CC AA CC AA CC AA BB
   bytes stream 34 bytes, redundancy 18 bytes

   4)
   input:  BB BB BB BB BB BB BB BB BB BB BB BB BB BB BB BB
   output: AA CC BB CC BB CC BB CC BB CC BB CC BB CC BB CC BB CC BB CC BB CC BB CC BB CC BB CC BB CC BB CC BB BB
   bytes stream 34 bytes, redundancy 18 bytes

   As you can see, the more bytes in message, which values are equal to values
of control bytes, the more redundancy it causes. The redundancy can't be more
than MESSAGE_SIZE * 2 + 2 (examples 4.2, 4.3, 4.4).

WARNING. There is one nuance. Imagine that we trying to send two messages in serial:
MESSAGE ONE: DD DD DD DD DD DD CC DD DD DD DD DD
MESSAGE TWO: DD DD DD DD DD DD DD DD DD DD DD DD
Result bytes stream: AA DD DD DD DD DD DD CC CC DD DD DD DD DD BB AA DD DD DD DD DD DD DD DD DD DD DD DD BB

Than imagine situation:
Transmitter is sending AA DD DD DD DD DD DD CC -> some distortion happened -> transmitter start sending next message.

So we get such (from the point of view of the receiver) bytes stream:
AA DD DD DD DD DD DD CC AA DD DD DD DD DD DD DD DD DD DD DD DD BB

Error for too long message will be detected and we will lose second message because
start byte of second message will be interpreted as byte that must be rejected.


Example for code use:

//define callback
void ll_message_ready_cb(uint8_t* const message)
{
    printf("ready: ");
    for(size_t i = 0; i < MESSAGE_SIZE; i++)
    {
        printf("%02X ", message[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");
}

//define callback
void ll_error_cb(ll_protocol_err_t error)
{
    if(error == LL_PROTOCOL_ERR_MESSAGE_TOO_SHORT)
    {
        printf("LL_PROTOCOL_ERR_MESSAGE_TOO_SHORT\n");
    }
    if(error == LL_PROTOCOL_ERR_MESSAGE_TOO_LONG)
    {
        printf("LL_PROTOCOL_ERR_MESSAGE_TOO_LONG\n");
    }
}

void transmitter_node()
{
    uint8_t data[MESSAGE_SIZE] =
    {
        0xCC, 0xCC, 0xDD, 0xDD,
        0xDD, 0xDD, 0xDD, 0xDD,
        0xDD, 0xDD, 0xDD, 0xDD,
        0xDD, 0xDD, 0xDD, 0xDD
    };

    size_t byte_stream_size = ll_sizeof_serialized(data);
    uint8_t* byte_stream = (uint8_t*)malloc(byte_stream_size);
    ll_serialize(data, byte_stream);

    transmit(byte_stream, byte_stream_size);
}

void receiver_node(uint8_t* byte_stream, size_t byte_stream_size)
{
    size_t _remainder;
    ll_deserialize(byte_stream, byte_stream_size, &_remainder);
    //or you can implement calling of ll_deserialize in loop
}
